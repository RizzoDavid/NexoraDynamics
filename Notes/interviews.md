### Notes
    - Noticable slowdown on network
    - webpages taking much longer to load than usual
    - Users reported difficulty accessing services
        - Few cases sevice unavailable errors
    - Sudden spike of traffic from a range of IP Addresses that do not typically interact with the network
    - Bandwidth usage unusally high
        - No increase in legitimate user activity
    -Possiblity of more down time & performace issues

#### Oberservations
    - Increase Network Traffic
    - Slow and unresponsive web traffic and devices
    - Productivity lowered
        - Denial of service by increasing network traffic to a point of inusability
