Key Infastructure Imacated, Integral to both inertnal operationbs and external system delivery

Web Server puiblic facing application
    Substancial delays in response times and service availablitlity to to abnormla traffic volumes
    Increase page load times and intermittented unavailabliltiy 
Database Server | proccessing and storing critical business data
    Resource exhaustion
    CPU and Memory usuage spiked significantly during the period of disruption leading to crashes and data restrieval issues
Load Balancer
    unable to handle the suddent increase in incoming requests
    system strugled to maintain an even distribution causing some servers to become overwhelmeed while other remained under utalized
Firewall
    Has been under heacvy strain due to to the high volume of incoming connection attempts
    Many were flagged as suspicious
    proccesing and inspection processes caused bottlenecks 
        further contributing to system slowdowns
Router
    handling a significant amount of unexpected traffic
    resulted in packet loss and increased latency
    distrupted data flow and contributed to network instability
switch
    experienced congestion due to excessive traffic between devices
    Delays in internal communications and degraded performance or critical internal applications
Contend Delivery Network (CDN)
    Responsible for distributing content to users has experienced significant delays in delivering services to clients
    Unuasally high traffic volumes have overburdened the CDNs capactity causing delys and occasianl time outs in content delivery
DNS Server
    Heaveliy targeted leading to disruptions in resolving domain names to ip addresses 
    Caused widespread connectivity issues in both internal and extneral users
Email Server
    Significant backlog of emails and delays in delivery due to netwokr congestions
    impacted internal communication and delayed responses to external queryies 
VPN Gateway
    Responsible for managing secure remote connections has been intermittenlty inaccessible 
    Influx of connection attempts overloaded the gateway affecting access for employees and partners
